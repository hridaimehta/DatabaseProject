# DatabaseProject
This project involved designing and implementing a simulation of youtube database based on publicly available data. I along with 2 others modelled the database, applied techniques, and used SQL to formulate and run queries based on concepts learned in class. The databse is stored in a remote server.

Furthermore, we created a front-end interface which allows a person (an analyst) to access and use  our database and run useful yet interesting queries without allowing entering SQL commands to prevent SQL injection.Our interface supports an analyst trying to answer interesting questions they might have of the data, which are not easily answerable.
